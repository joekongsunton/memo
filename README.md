# Memo

This repo will mainly present hints about differents tools/frameworks/technologies that i'm learning. 
If on some subjects installation guidelines are not presented here, they may be found in the README.md of my "trySTUFF" repositories.
For example, i won't rewrite installation steps of a drupal project since it's already done on my repo "trydrupal".

#### How does it work

Each main theme/technology will have its own directory in here ( and then their own subdirectories ). 
For each directory, a README.md will present things that i found interesting to remind/write/note about the subject.

That's all ;)
